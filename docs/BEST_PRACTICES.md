# Kubernetes Best Practices Implementation

This document outlines the best practices implemented in this canary deployment demo.

## 📁 Project Structure

### Directory Organization
```
manifests/
├── frontend/          # Frontend-specific resources
├── backend/           # Backend-specific resources  
└── ingress/           # Ingress resources
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to find and modify specific components
- Supports team ownership (frontend team owns frontend/, etc.)
- Scales well as project grows

### File Naming Convention
- `configmap.yaml` - Configuration data
- `rollout.yaml` - Deployment logic
- `services.yaml` - Service definitions
- `*-ingress.yaml` - Ingress resources

**Benefits:**
- Predictable file locations
- Consistent naming across components
- Easy to understand file purpose

## 🏷️ Labeling Strategy

### Consistent Labels
All resources include:
```yaml
labels:
  app: frontend|backend          # Application name
  component: config|service|rollout|ingress  # Resource type
  type: stable|canary|main       # Service variant (for services)
  version: stable                # Version (for pods)
```

**Benefits:**
- Easy resource discovery with `kubectl get pods -l app=frontend`
- Supports monitoring and observability tools
- Enables RBAC policies based on labels
- Facilitates automated operations

## 🔧 Resource Organization

### ConfigMaps
- Separate from deployment logic
- Easy to modify without touching rollouts
- Proper labeling for lifecycle management

### Services
- Three service types per component (stable/canary/main)
- Consistent port naming (`http`)
- Proper selectors and labels

### Rollouts
- Clean separation per component
- Proper resource limits and requests
- Health checks configured
- Consistent volume mounts

### Ingresses
- One ingress per service for better management
- Internal ALBs for security
- Proper annotations for AWS Load Balancer Controller

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### Network Security
- Internal ALBs only (not internet-facing)
- Proper service-to-service communication
- No hardcoded secrets in manifests

### Resource Limits
```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "64Mi"
    cpu: "50m"
  limits:
    memory: "128Mi"
    cpu: "100m"
```

### Health Checks
- Liveness and readiness probes configured
- Proper startup delays and intervals

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy

### Automation
- `deploy.sh` - Automated deployment in correct order
- `cleanup.sh` - Proper cleanup in reverse order
- Error handling with `set -e`

### Deployment Order
1. ConfigMaps (configuration)
2. Services (networking)
3. Rollouts (workloads)
4. Ingresses (external access)

**Benefits:**
- Prevents dependency issues
- Ensures resources are available when needed
- Consistent deployment process

## 📊 Monitoring and Observability

### Resource Identification
- Pod hostnames in responses for debugging
- Proper labels for metric collection
- Health endpoints for monitoring

### Rollout Monitoring
```bash
kubectl argo rollouts get rollout frontend-rollout --watch
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Local Testing
- Port forwarding for development
- Curl commands for basic functionality
- Pod exec for internal testing

### Canary Testing
- Gradual traffic shifting (25% → 50% → 75% → 100%)
- Pause points for validation
- Easy promotion/abort commands

## 📚 Documentation

### README Structure
- Clear project overview
- Step-by-step instructions
- Architecture explanation
- Troubleshooting guide

### Code Comments
- Inline YAML comments explaining complex configurations
- Script comments for maintenance

## 🔄 Maintenance

### File Size Management
- Small, focused YAML files (< 100 lines each)
- Easy to review and modify
- Version control friendly

### Dependency Management
- Clear resource dependencies
- Proper cleanup order
- No circular dependencies

## 🎯 Benefits Achieved

1. **Maintainability** - Easy to modify individual components
2. **Scalability** - Structure supports adding new services
3. **Security** - Proper network isolation and resource limits
4. **Reliability** - Health checks and proper deployment order
5. **Observability** - Consistent labeling and monitoring
6. **Team Collaboration** - Clear ownership boundaries
7. **Automation** - Scripted deployment and cleanup
8. **Documentation** - Comprehensive guides and examples

This structure follows Kubernetes community best practices and scales well for production environments.
